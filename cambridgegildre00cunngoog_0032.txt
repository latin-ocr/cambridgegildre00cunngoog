education, for many founded 01 partly endowed grammar
sohools¹‚ but the foundation 01 0 college was a more ambitione
undertaking than is recorded of any similar society. It was
further of peculiar interest as an affort mede towards healing
an old feud between town and university.

The original mowers of the Cambridge scheme for a gild’s

college may well have been the future Mastcr, Thomas of
Eltisley, chaplain 10 the archbishop of (lanterbury and rector of

Lambeth, or the two first Fellows‚ the chaplains Campe and
Rayson, who entered the gild 1350. Among the burgesses‚ the

gild had ceonred, forits treasurer‚ William Horwood, who as
Mayor in March 1352 used his scal of the mayoralty² because
the seals of the Alderman and brethren of the gild “are not
sufficiently well known³.'’ (The Duke 01 1110000101 000 hardly
have been Alderman at that time or his seal would have been
used.) Tangmere, the founder 01 the lepers’ hospital 01 St
Anthony and St Eloy‚ no doubt had entered the gild before the
minutas begin. Another Mayor, Robert de Brigham, who died
of the plague in 1349, was in St Mary’s Gild. How the support
of Henry, Duke of Lancester (he was made Duke in 1351)

¹ was got, does not appear, but Sir Walter Manny wasone of

his intimates, and Manny’s whole family was enrolled in the
gild. In 1348 Manny had been Gonwille's chief instrument
in obtaining leave 10 found his Hall of the Annunciation of
the Virgin Mary⁴. His influence with Quaen Philippa, whose
direct interest in the gild’s college scheme Josselin considers
proved, may well have been all important.
