GILD OT OORPUS CHRISTI AND ST Maur. xxv

Mortmain Act. Such a grant (it has been accidentally omitted
from the Appendix) was made Dec. 30, 1358, by Henry de
Charite of Cherry Hinton andRichard Collesson 01 the same,
to Henry ot Tangmere, Master Thomas of Eltisley senior,
William Horwocd and Henry of Milton (hliddelton) ol aquarry
in Oheny Hinton (0. O. Τ, Box 31, No. 106), and here there
’ is no indication that these donees were in reality “feofiors 10
uses.” But the belief that the stone of tbis quarry went 10 the
building of the college is probably justified¹. The Burwell
property, it will be seen, was lost to the college through the
discovery that the lring's leave for an alienation to the gild had
not been obtained.

On March 21,1356²,statutes were drawn up which shew
the relations of the gild and the college to have been then
still close. But according to Josselin these were not the first
statutes and he refers-to three several redactions, giving, after
his usual oustom, dates which will not bear close inspection,
dates which throw doubt upon the correctness of eschol llis
statements. The first code, he says, was confirmed by Thomas

bishop of Ely in the first year of his consecration. Olearly
he alludes to Thomas de Lisle, bishop 1345-1362, not to

Thomas Arundel, bishop 1371-1388. Upon Josselin's unsnp·
ported authority it is impossible to believe that the college
statutes were drafted seven years before the college ¹was
founded. The next confirmation, he says, was in Thomas (de
Lisle's) eighth year (1353) and was given by the bishop and the
Ely chapter. He may possibly be alluding to the sanction of

the “ordinacio⁸'' 1353 (Appendix I. No. 43) which was given by -

the bishop and chapter in 1355. The third edition, he says, was
given under the scal of the fraternity, and he names no date.
This presumably is the code of statutas of 1356, the only early
code 01 which a 10111 remains, and perhaps the only early code
ever drafted. This code agrees with Josselin's description
