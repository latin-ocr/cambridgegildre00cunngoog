sr nnnr’s 0110. xiii

Bede Roll opens with the name 01 1101011 01 Madingley, who was

bailiff repeatedly in Henry III's reign, and in 1282 and 1285.
Two ol the earliest conveyances, preserved 10 110 Corpus
Christi muniment room, 1010110 0 grant 01 rent made by his
widow, and her charter (like another without date) contains 0
clause providing an alternative nse 101110 money in the event
01110 cessation 01110 gild (App. I. No. 2).

11 was probably then, even after 1285, still a youthfnl in-
stitution, with a future still unassnred. That it was not 10
existence in 1278 seems certain from the omission 01 011 mention
01 11 10 110 Hundred Rolls. In that methodicsl survey it must.
have appeared had it possessed land or rent. All the Mendicant
fraternities 010 mentioned, but no gild appears¹. St Mary's
Ohurch is named repeatedly in connexion with its many candle-
rents, and a chaplain 01 Our Lady Mass was receiving rents to
endew the Virgin’s Mass in her church in the market-place2.
But in all this there is no trace 01 110 co-operation 01 0 gild.
The gild probably became active when in 1290 110 01010101
(11001 81 Mary’s was bumtl.

From the first it is clear that the Gild 01 81 Mary 10 closely

associated with Great St Mary’s Ohurch, the church in the , v

marhot-place, as it was called. It is called sometimes merely ‚
110 Gild 01 81 Mary‚ sometimes the Gild 01 110 Chnrch 01
81 Mary; its members are an Alderman, brethren and sistere
01 81 Mary's Gild belonging 10 110 010101 01 110 Virgin. Its
benefactore direct that, should the gild cease, the benefaction
shall go to the 00101101100 01 001 Lady Mass in her church.

In two 0101101001 1303 110 gildis called, by exception, the
Gild 01 Μο1010010 01 110 blessed Virgin 01 Cambridge. This
11110, coupled with the references in the minute-book to certain
financial dealings in corn and mill-stones, might lead one to
