uncertain what 10110 was intended. In the index the names
01 villages are given under the modern spelling, with a cross
reference under the old spelling

· Some curious spellings will be noticed, especially in the
Gild Rolls: the scribe uses repeatedly 3 101 y and writes

recongnovit, mangnus, and renguum lor recognovit, magnus
and regnum.

The transcript 01 the Gild Rolls was prepared 101 the Society ι
sometime ago by Mr Alfred Rogers, with a view 10 their inclu-
01οο 10 0 book on the Cambridge gilde to be edited by Miss
Ruth Anderson. Owing 10 ill-health Miss Anderson was
obliged 10 relinquish the taslr, but her collectione were gene-
rously placed at the disposal 01 the Society and have been 01
much service to me. In particular I should point out that she
prepared copies 01 some of the gild returns 01 1389 and 01 the
conveyances in the Corpus Christi College treasury 11010 which
the endowment 01 the St Mary’s and Corpus Christi Gilds can
he traced. She likewise ransacked the Cole Manuscripts 101
, illustrative matter, and I have made abundant use 01 her notes.

To Miss Lucy Toulmin Smith Ι 010 indebted 101 the use 01
excellent transcripts 01 two 01 the gild returns which were
prepared for her father.

Mr Stanley Leathes lrindly read the prool 10 00 early stage
and saved me 11010 many blunders. The Society’s secretary, who
has collected so much 101 the history 01 the gilds 01 the borough
and 01 the county, has been indefatigable in assisting the pro·
gress 01 the worlr. Finally it remains 10 thank the Master and
Fellows of Corpus Christi College 101 kind permission 10 print
from their recorda. The work, begun when Colonel Caldwell was
hursar‚ has been continued under the bursarship 01 111 Arnold
Wallis, and special thaulrs are due 10 them lor the readiness
with which they have met repeated elaims ou their time and
attention.
