gift is made to the Gild 01 Corpus Christi, never to the Gild 01
81 Mary.

The removal 01110 two St Mary's Gild chaplains celebrating
101 110 family of Sir John of Cambridge in Great St Mary’s, to
St Bene’t's and St Botulph's, shews how the association 01 110
gild with St Mary's Church might be disserered. Itis probable
that early in June 1353 110 gild's new college bad obtained
rights in St Botulph’s Church, and on June 28 811 Thomas
01 Cambridge agreed 10 transfer his chaplains, In 1361, by
will, he left money 10 re-endow a chaplaincy in St Mary'a
Cburch to celebrate for his family, and this money he put in
trust with the Master and scholars “ 01 the Cild 01 Corpus
Christi,'' a slip, apparently, for “of the college of the Gild
01 Corpus Christi.'’ This is the last indication of any con· '
nexion between the gild and St Mary's Church¹.

The five chaplains who celebrated for the Cild 01 81 Mary
in St Mary’s Church probably ceased so to celebrate when on
Nov. 7, 1352, Edward III licensed the transference 01 110
property, held in mortmain for their support, 10 110 Master and
scholare, “chaplains 01 0 house (or college) 01 Corpus Christi
and 81 Mary (about to be founded), who were to celebrate in
81 Bene’t’s Church.’' Apparently then the St Mary's Gild sunds
and estates were wholly merged in those 01 110 Corpus Christi
Gild and diverted to new purposes. The primary purpose was
the foundation 01 0 college of priests that should form part of ἵ
110 University. The original scheme, according to Josselin,
seems 10 have been a modest one, the endowment 01 0 Master 1
and two Fellows². The same writer states that Sir John 01
Cambridge added two chaplains. He is probably referring 10
110 two chaplains 01 Thomas 01 Carnbridge's grant, 1353
(Appendix I. No, 46).

The foundation 010 college in the University of Cambridge r

by Cambridge burgesses was a remarkable event3 not that this 1
gild was the first 01· the last to take part in the endowment 01 ,

¹The connexion between the college and the church (no doubt through
811 Thomas 01 Cambridge’s chaplains) led in 140010 a disputa between the ¹
college and 110 rectem Sandars' Great St Mary’r, p. 9.
