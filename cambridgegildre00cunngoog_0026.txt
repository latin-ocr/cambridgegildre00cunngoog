the meaning of such passages as that in the return made by a
Pam pisford gild in 1389, that a bushel ol barley is given to be
put in increase for-the use of the church (pur mettre en encres
al oeps del eglise). Although ale and the associative principle
are rarely to be dissevered1, we have notin St Mary’s Gild any
direct case in point.

The purpose of the St Mary’s Gild was primarily the pro-
vision of prayers for the members. The ‘congregation’ ol
brethren‚ sometimes brethren and sistere, met at irregular
intervals, to pass ordinances and elect officere. In 1300 they
agreed to attend St Mary's Ohurch on Jan. 2 to celebrate
solemn mass for dead members. The penalty for absence was
a half-pound of wax, consumed no doubt in the provision ol
gild-lights before the Alteros Our Lady. Richard Bateman
and his wife in their undated grant made the express condition

thatin return they should receive daily prayers for the health
of their souls (App. I. Ne. 7). In 1:307 an Alderman of the
Gild made provision for a gild chaplain to celebrate daily in St

l Mary’s Ohurch for the health of the donor while he lived, and
of the brethren‚ and sor his soul and the brethren's souls after

the donor¹s death. In the same year the gild passed an ordin-
ance directing the gild chaplains to celebrate two trentals ol

masses (60 in all) lor each dead brother. If the deceased left
anything in his will to the gild, then, as the Alderman might ¹

' appoint, the chaplains should do more or less celebration (sor
· the donor presumably) according to the amount bequeathed

to the gild. The rule is naive, but its spiritis unpleasing.
Individualism has thrust itself in where it seems very much
out of place. The enrolment of the souls of the dead further
witnesses to the purely religious character of the gild, and the
purchase ol a missal should also be notioed.

More than one chaplain entered the fraternity. Nioholas
the chaplain rendered the account for several years, and acted
as summoner. The Vicar of the Round Ohurch was a
member, and the Rector of St Michael's was a gild oouncillor.
