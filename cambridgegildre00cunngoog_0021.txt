century gild of thegns, that adds to the religione some secular ἵ
objects. The gild of Cambridge thegns was associated in
devotion to St Etheldreda: its members were vowed to be
faithful tc each other in religious and secular matters, Like all
the religious gilde of a later time, it was in some sense a burial
club; the society was bound to bring a dead member to the
place be chose for burial: those who came not to this duty were
lined. The gild paid half the cost of the funeral feast, and
every member was bound to offer ad. in alms, whercof a portion
went to St Etheldreda's Church. This compulsory oblation was
another characteristic of the religious gild. But the gild of
thegns offered further a secular protection of which the later
gilds knew nothing. The society would help the thegn who
had the juster cause: it provided assurance against wrongs, and

help in the recovery of damages. The later gilde of Cambridge κ

do not contain this secular element, and are specimens of the
religione gild pure and simple.

That a religione gild existed in Cambridge in the twelfth
century is known from an isolated reference in the history of

'the ahbey 'of Ramsey¹. A fraternity of the Holy Sepulchra
existed 1114-1130; its purpose was declared to be the building ,
of a minster in honour of God and the Holy Sepulchre: and
its work was the Cambridge Round Church.

From this point nothing is known of any similar association
in Cambridge until in the reign of Edward I we begin to find
conveyances of land made to a Gild of St Mary. The earliest
of these are undated and do not name the Mayor aud bailiffs
among the witnesses². The first that does this (App. I. No. 6)
dates probably from 1284-5. But it will be notioed that the

plete and exact by the use of college conveyances, which ought to be systemati-
cally calendared.
