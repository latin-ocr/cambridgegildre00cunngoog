With the enrolment 01 the Manny family, of the Duke of
Lanoaster and some 01 the chief members 01 his household,
success was secure. A number 01 London burgesses and
Cambridge people who had migrated 10 London added their
benefactione, and 140 came in from Walter Ncel, a London
benefactor 01 the University.

The Duke, who 00 March 21, 1353 calls himself Alderman
01 the Gild, negociated the legal business for the foundation
01 th‘e college, “a house 01 scholam, chaplains and others,''
with Thomas 01 Eltisley as Master. Two years later the
formal consent 01 the Chancellor and Masters 01 the Univer-
sity, 01 the Bishop 01 aly, and of the prior and chapter 01 Ery,
was obtained.

On June 1, 1353, the gild succeeded by an exchangc in
securing a hostel in Lourteburgh, now Free School, Lane.
Gonville’s executore agreed to hand over to the Master, scholare
and Gild 01 Corpus Christi and St Mary this building with its
site, together with rights in the church 01 81 Botulph, then
belonging to the Oountess 01 Pembroke and her college. How
these rights were obtained does 001 appear. In erchange, the
gild was to give upthe stone hostel, at 000 time Sir John 01
Cambridge's property, with Goldcorn’s messuage adjoining.

On the minutas 01 the gild is enrolled a gift 01 brewing
vessels 10 the use 01 the Master and scholare 01 the gild's college
“ so that the said vessels shall nowise be used by the Alderman
or brethren 01 the gild except within the ‘close’ 01 the college.''
Gifts to the college and gifts to the gild, and gifts 10 the gild l

Α “ 10 the use” 01 the college, are alike entered 00 the minutes.

The reversion 01 the advowson 01 81 Bene't's had been
obtained in 1350, by certain persons, acting 00 doubt as
agents 01 the gild. In 1353 the then rector entered the gild
and “by the ordinance 01 his friends” he resigned the church to

the bishop “gratia” that the “brethren and those who had
acquired the advowson’' might enter upon their possession 01
the presentation. The other gifts 10 the gild may be traced in
the minutes and also from the conveyances. Some 01 these, it
