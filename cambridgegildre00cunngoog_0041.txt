given to members whose poverty was not due to their own
fault. The Latin phrases used to express this intention would
scarcely satissy the committee of a Charity Organization Society.
Members who become poor “by God's grace ” shall have td. ο
weekly, while the money in the gild chest holds out: another
will give od. a week during poverty to a member who is reduced ¹

through sickuess or accident, but if there are many victims of
mischanee, the sum is to be cut down as the gild officere direct:
a needy gild will give ld. a week to be equally divided among
poor members who are faithful and conceal gild secrets; the
skinners would give vd. a week to any member lying sick in
Cambridge and having no means to support life, and if gild
lunda did not suffice, each member was to subscribe what he

could. Similarly the skinners’ fund for the funeral expensas of

the poor was to be eked out by voluntary subscriptione A poor
gild proposes to give vd. weekly and a new tunic yearly to a
single poor member, reduced to poverty by accident, not through
larceny or whoring. If there are two such persone, the gild will
give ld. and a new tunic to each till it can afford more.
Another provides the usual vd. each weekly, and adds that the
gild charges-will be canoelled in such cases: another richer gild
supplements this with a tunic and hood to each relief case, and
will keep the widows of poor members while they are of good
conduct. The last of the gilds iu its poverty cau only afford
vd. weekly in charity3 if there are two poor members they must
divide the money equally.

From this evidence it will be seen that insuranoe against
losses and sickness can only in a narrow sense be regarded as a
gild object. In the caseos a rich society, the relief offered
might be sufficient to make membership desirable, but the
richer societies charged heavier entrance and annual sees, so
that presumably the poor could not enter. The poor societies
that could give only a penny a day in charity to one, or a
halfpenny to two needy brethren, offered no secure insuranoe
to candidates for membership. The rule enjoining some small
expenditure in charity seems rather then a part of the religious
side of the gild work than a definite scheme for mutual in-
suranco.
