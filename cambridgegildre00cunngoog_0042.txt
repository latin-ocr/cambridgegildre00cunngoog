The richest of these societies were the Gild of the Purifica-
tion in Great St Mary's, with an annual subscription of Ta, and
r that of the Holy Trinity in 'Holy Trinity, with the same
Χ subscription and an entrance fec of 13⁸. sd. The lowest yearly
subscription in any of the gilda was lod. Three out ol the
l eight societies, and those not all the richest, made the admission
l of candidates depcnd on election: the others admitted all who
paid the sees and took the necessary oaths to keep the gild
rules and (generally) to conceal its secrets. Arrangements were
j, made in some cases to release poor members from less, orto let

κ them withdraw and re-enter when richer.

The skinners' gild alone required the members to provide
themselves with a livery. The garments were to be bought out
ol the common fonds and a gild officer was to arrange the
distribution and see that the chcst was refunded. Three other

ι gilds, including the lest, a poor one, required the use ol the

livery, ‘⁴ if the members have auy‚'' on the occasions when
members went in procession, two and two, to church. From
ἵ all these gilds, including those of Corpus Christi and St Mary,
the social clement is lacking inasmuch as there are no regula-
tions pointing to conviviality or leasting.

All the mles contain clauses expressing the common inten-
tion to promote internal harmony and brotherly love: this was

l part ol their religious purpose. One gild required that the

1 newly admitted member should kiss the others in token of
K fraternity. For the promotion of harmony there were clauses
y requiring members to submit their disputes to the arbitration
ζ of the gild officere, and clauses arranging lor the ejection of
ἵ nnruly orobjectionable persons. One gild ejects members who
keep bad company, play (and gemble) at dico or chess, or
frequent the streete at night without reasonable cause. Another
expressly forbids seditious, foul or profane talk in church.

All but three ol the gilds placed themselves under the
power of the Bishop of Ely, and made it a rule that, when the
' gild officers could not enforcc their authority, the unruly
member was to be denounced as a perjuros, and the bishop’s
powers of summary conviction—“ sine strepitu et figura judicii,”
to use the highly coloured phrase of church diplomatis-were
