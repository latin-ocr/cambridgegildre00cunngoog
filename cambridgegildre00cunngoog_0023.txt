believe that the Gild of St Mary was in reality a merchant gild
that had taken on the aspect of the religious gild. The idea,
though in all likelihood it is mistaken‚ is not one that can be
dismissed quite lightly. Ιι is well known that some of the
merchant gilds, associations that included as members the
whole number of persons who were free to trade in the
borough, did occasionally commend themselves ιο saintly
patronage, endow chaplains ιο celebrate mass at altars in the
church of the borongh, and pledge themselves occasionally to
good works and devotional exercises¹. ·

Cambridge had been granted a merchant gild 'by John’s
charter of 1201, and the fact that we know next to nothing of
the merchant gild at Cambridge leaves abundant play for the
imagination All merchant gilds are alike in so far as they are
the means by which men were admitted to trade in the borongh,
and ultimately the means by which men were admitted ιο all

the franchises of the borongh. But there are varieties,'and in ,

one case the traders and burgesses may not speedily fuse, in

another they may neverhave been distinct. At Cambridge, ,if ¹

the merchant gild were the Gild of Merchants of St Mary then
we must assume that the two bodies held apart. The Alderman
of the Gild ol' st· Mary generally was not the Mayor of the

borought‘ Its accounts and its minutas are wholly distinct from
those of the borongh.

But Professor Maitland has argued⁸ in favour of the belief ’
that at Cambridge no merchant gild existed apart from the ἓ
general body of burgesseS, and the evidence derived from this χ
phrase “ Gild of Merobants of st Mary’' cannot really be con· ’

sidered as in any way adequate to destroy that belief. The

bulk of the evidence goes ιο shew that the association was a ἒ

private one, created solely for religious purposea The society

consisted of many important burgesseS, but cannot have been ¹

coextensivs with the trading community. , The ultimate coales-
cence of St Mary’s Gild with the Gild of Corpus Christi, aud

¹ abundant references will bo found in Gross, ailo Moratum, 1. 34.
² John Buth and John Dunning may both have been Mayors whilst they
were Aldermen ol the gild.
