old town gild, while it is probable that the Corpus Christi Gild
sprung up in connection with the new devotion which spread
through the country in the fourteenth century.

The traces of craft gilds at Cambridge are scanty: this was
not due to the absence of artisans ; the sbearmen in Shearers'
Row and the wool-cumbere, who held a procession on St Blaise's
day, have left their traces, but there does not appear to have
been any local gild or company in connection with the clothing
trade. Some skinncrs had indeed formed a gild of their own
in honour of St Katherine, but they made no effort to keep
the membership or management of the gild entirely in the
hands of men of their own craft, and they do not seem to
have contemplated any trade objecta in founding their society.
It is possible that the existence of the University, and the
rights of market supervision which it possessed, interfered with ⁸
the development of bodies of townsmen, under municipal au·
thority, for the purpose of mutual supervision. lt is interesting
to notice that, however widely diffused and common the
practice of association ior common objecta might be, consider-
able pains were taken to control it; and that while towns were
vigilant in permitting the existing or overhauling the proposed
regulations of such bodies as professed to regulate trade, the
ecclesiastical authorities were on the alert to protect the
parishiouers from the intrusion of private corporations in the

use of the churches of the town. The most clearly defined line

which we can hope to draw between merely ‘social' gilds and
‘religious' or ‘craft' gilde, is likely to be found by noting the
purpose for which any particular body desired to obtain special
powers, and the nature ol the public authority which it had to
approach in order to secure them.

We need not expect to find much evidence in Cambridge of
the late survival of gilds: that is to be traced in centres where
the municipal lite was particularly strong, and where from
