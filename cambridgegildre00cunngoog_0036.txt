aslring for restitution¹. As the muniments of the college are
to this day fairly complete, this restitution seems to have been
effected.

The statement that the gild was in existence in 1408 does
not appear to be founded on good evidence². There is no return
110111 this gild among the Chancery Gild Certilicates of 1389,
but as these are probably not complete, this is no certain
argument that the gild had ceased to exist. Until the oon·
veyances and wills preserved in college muniment·rooms have
been calendared a work too long neglected, we must be content
to rest upon the presumption that the gild lapsed early in the
reign 01 Richard II. The causes of its downfall may well be
closely associated with the story of the rising of 1381, but
at present we can only guess what actually happened.

The St Mary's Gild Rolls consist 01 seven membranas 01
parchment, two being tecked together. The three membranas
on which the Bede Rolls are written I have distinguished as
A, B and C. The Corpus Christi Gild Rolls are written on

paper‚ folded to form a book.

The Cambridge returns 10 the enquiry made by royal order
in 1389 into the history and endowments of gilds have been
printed here as the best means of illustrating the nature 01 the
Gilds 01 Corpus Christi and St Mary, whose rules we have not
got. The officere 01 the Publio Record Office report that the
list of these Chancery Gild Certificates, as they are called, is
steadily increasing, but at present eight only have b'een re·
covered for Cambridge. They are all in Latin and, for that reason
no doubt, were but briefly dealt with in Mr Toulmin Smith's
book on gilde printed 101 the Early English Text Society⁸.
