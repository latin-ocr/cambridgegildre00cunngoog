By his proclamatiou dated Jan. 31,1389¹, the king enquired
as to the origin 001 governance 01 00010 gild, the oaths taken,
the meetings held, aud the usages 001 000100ος specially he
enquired 01 011 10010 001 00010 01 1100 gilds, whether held in
00010010 00 001, 01 011 goods and chattels and in whose hands
they might be for-the use 01 the gild, of their true yearly value,
and this on pain 01 10101 1001011000 11 0 10100 00100 were made.
Ι1 the gild had any charters, copies were to be seut in, and the
001000 000 10 be accompanied by 0 statement as to when,
where 001 by whom the proclamation commanding enquiry had
been made.

The primary purpose 01 this 00001 0000100100 01 0000100
1010 the fraternities was to discover how lar it might be neees-
sary 10 put a stop to the licensing 01 further mortmains, 10 the
passing 01 fresh endowments into the dead hands 01 the saints
who were the patrous 01 these associatione The result of the
enquiry was the statute 01 15 Richard II, 0. 5, which definitely
brought the gilds as 0011 as other communities under the
statute 10 religiosis 10 respect 01 011 10010, tenements and
possessions already acquired 0010 be acquired. The enquiry
and the statute loreshadow the action 01 Ηο000 VIII, who by
his statute 23 Henry VIII, 0. 10, forbade leoffments to the 000
01 gilds and communities: the statute 37 Henry VIII, 0. 4,
dissolved the religious fraternities.

I have printed the returns iu the order in which they 000
preserved 01 the Record Offioe. It would be difficolt to arrange
them iu chronological order because it is uncertain whether the
dates given in each record, except the last, are dates 01 origin,
dates 01 the issue 01 the first code 01 01010100, 00 10100 01 the
revision 0101010100. If the dates be taken as dates 01 origin, 011
the foundations 1011 between 1379 and 13862: 001 the one
return which is 0010101 gives no indication 01 00 earlier origin.
Three 01 the gilds were attached 10 Great St Mary's (one in
honour 01 the Holy Trinity, two in honour 01 the 100010 01 the
Virgin), two were attached 10 Ηο10 Trinity Ohurch, and 000
