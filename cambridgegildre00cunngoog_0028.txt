courus cuarsrr erno. xix

Sir John of Cambridge, the judge, was Alderman 01 this gild
and then gave the pyr, weighing 78 oa, which was sold in the
reign 01 Henry VIII. He was alderman als0, Josselin says, in
1347 “about which time he died.’' But as a matter 01 fact be
died in 1335, and thus the whole story is thrown into doubt.
It has already been pointed out that be was Alderman of
St Mary's Gild in 1311. His messuage, on which Gonville
court was ultimately to be built, passed to St Mary’s Gild in 1344
(Appendix I. Nc. 21). 10000110 is likewise the only authority
101 John Goldeorn's undated aldermanship, and 101 the state·
ment that bis born¹ was given 1ο the Corpus Christi Gild. His
statement that in 1342 Henry 01 Tangmere gave the Cild 01
Corpus Christi his griffin’s egg, does not harmoniae with an
early entry on the college accounts which records that the gift
came 10 the college by Tangmere's will. Tangmere was living
in 1361.

We must definitely set aside too a number 01 statements
with regard to the early history of the Corpus Christi Gild and

¹ of the college which have arisen out 01 the misdating and
i misinterpretation 01 a portion of the manuscript containing the

gild minutes It will be noticed that in the accompanying text
certain accounts which form part 01 the manuscript that

contains the minutes 01 the Corpus Christi (illd, 1350-1361, .

have not been printed. Oi these accounts Mr Riley gave an

’ abstract 101 the Historical Manuscripts Commission², treating

thern as gild accounts and ascribing them to 22 Edward III,
1348. They are in reality not gild but college accounts, and
belong to 22 Richard ΙΙ, 1399. 11 was easy to make such a
mistake‚ for where the regnal year first occurs, it is nearly
obliterated, and the accounts have been scribbled in among the
gild minutes wherever space happened to be left. But the lact
that throughout the Duke, not the Earl, 01 Lancastcr‚ is spoken
01, puts the date 22 Edward III out 01 the question, and
furthermore the regnal year 22 Richard II is penned in one
place quite clearly. A number 01 details make it certain that
the accounts are rendered by officers 01 the college and not 01
