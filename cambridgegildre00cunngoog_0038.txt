each tc St Andrew’s‚ St Bene’t's and St Botnlph's. In each case “
we are given the names of the Cambridge burgesses chiefly
instrumental in founding cr restoring the gild. In one case
only, that of the gild of St Katherine in the Church of
St Bene’t—or, to give its full title, the gild of Jesus Christ,
St Mary, St Katherine, the Martyrs and All Saints-all the
founders were of one craft, the skinners’. But that it was not ,
intended to exclude men of other trades is made clear by the
rule which required that one of the warden¹s two subordinate
officere, called “promotors,'' must be a skinner. In every code
it is made clear that the gild is not confined to residente
of a particular parish. But in one it is required that the
ordinances should be made known in the parish whose churcb
was to be used, and in the Gild of the Assumption in Holy
Trinity Chnrch, it was required that one of the two rectors, as
the chief officers of the society were called, should be of Holy
Trinity parish, if a suitable person could be found. The Holy
Trinity Gild in the same church made it a rule that no ecclesi-
astic, above all no priest, might hold office in this body, or
administer gild property, for it is unfitting that clerks should
be mixed up in secular business. The Gild of the Annuuciaticn
in Great St Mary's excluded from the gild all chaplains, bakers,
and women whose husbands were not enrolled as members¹.
It is not easy to suggest reasons for all these varied antipathies,
but as the primary purpose of the gild's existence in every case
purporls to be the increase of religious devotion, and the
promotion of harmony, founders took care, at the start, to
exclude any possible disturbing elementa. A founder who
happened to have an enemy who balred might be at paine to
exclude all bakers Having regard to the alleged purpose of
the gilds, the exclusion of chaplains from the membership in
one case and of priests from office in another (a gild which

enjoyed episcopal indulgence)-on the ground that gild business
is secular-—is hardest of all to explain. It may be noted that
the gild which excluded chaplains from membership was not
one of those which placed itself under the authority of the
