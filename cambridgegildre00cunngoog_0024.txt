the almost certain extinction of the united gild early in the
reign of Richard ΙΙ would be hard indeed to explain on the
hypothesis that the merchant gild is here. When in 1303 the
gild is described as “fraternitas gilde mercatorum beate Marie,”
we must believe that the phrase is used in no technical sense.
A number of shoplreepers and dealers of both sexes desired

. 1ο see the Mass of Our Lady endowed in the church in the

market-place and formed a society to endow it. The. Bede
Roll swelled; and the hint of commercial origin was dropped
from the title.

The extant Bede Rolls shew that most of the considerable

² burgesses belonged to it, but the subsidy·roll of 1314-5, printed

as Appendix ΙΙ will also shew that the gildsmen who have
become the ‘parochiani’ of a particular mass, are but a select
’ few as compared with the total number of tax-payers, who
presumably all enjoy the franchise of the borough, and are
merchant-gildsmen.

With the first entries on the minute-book of this fraternity
we are challenged to explain a number of curicus particulars
connected with certain dealings of the brethren and sisters in
malt and the grains that produce malt. From 1298-1319, the
years covered by the record, the income of the gild was made
mainly out of malt. There wasa fine paid by new members

entering the gild, a fine that varies greatly in amount, no doubt
according to the means of the candidate for membership. This

fine may be paid in money, wax, grain, or malt, just as in
Saxon times the Exeter gildsmen had paid in malt and honey,
or the Abbotsbury gildsmen in “gild sesters of clean wheat’'
and penn'orths of wax. Most of the members of St Mary's Gild
gave two quarters of malt only: many gave the two quarters and
some wax (the amount is not named); many paid 61811. and
some wax3 some gave service to the gild3 some gave an annual
rent; the master of a house of Hospitallers paid heavily for
membership‚ three quarters of wheat on entry, and one quarter
annually. The gild then has, besides money in its common
chest, many ‘quarters of grain and malt which must be disposed

v . of. It appears that certain members of the gild take these

commodities on loan, and the gild-members at their meeting or
