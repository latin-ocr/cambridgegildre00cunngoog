some special reasons municipal institutions continued to control
a department of life which hed elsewhere come under the

cognisance of national authorities. The noblest memorial of ,

the Cambridge gilds consists of the college which was endowcd · ,
by the munificence of St Mary’s Gild and Corpus Christi Cild: ¹
it perpetuatas their names in its own. The care of one of the

Masters enriched it with priceless treasures, and has given its
Library a unique value. The men of the Cambridge gilds have

been benefactore to all students of English history, by providing Ἴ

the place where so many of the manuscripts collected by Parker

are housed and preserved. What the conscious aim of the gilds ¹

may have been in founding the college we do not knoW, for
they have not recorded it. Perhaps they were less influenced
by a love of learning, pure and simple, than by a desire to
found a college of priests to whom the duty of offering regular
prayers for the departed brethren and aisters might be fitly

entrusted. In any case we cannot but feel that it was a very l

remarkable undertaking, in other towns the gilds devoted
their energies to public works of many kinds-to maintaining
the sea-banks at Lynn, to sustaining the aged at Coventry, and
to edueating the children at Ludlow. ln embarking on the
enterprise of founding a college, the Cambridge men seem,
however, to stand alone; we can at least besure that the
presence of the University here afforded the conditione which
rendered it possible for their liberality to take this form.
