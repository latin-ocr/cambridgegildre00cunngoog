the pedigree which had been provided for Trade Unicus and

raised the question whether they were of ancient lineage at all.
Still further, Professor Ashley re-examined the evidence as to

the confiscation of gild property, and showed that the sweeping
charges which had been brought against Henry VIII and
Edward VI vereat all events imperfectly proved. During the
last ten years we have learned that if we are to get to the
truth about mediaeval gilds, we must abendon many currently
accepted opinions, aud commence the work of detailed research
once more. We cannot classify gilds satisfactorily, until we
know how lar the same gild preserved the same character
throughout its whole history, or whether it took on new
functione to meet the requireurents of a new era. We do not
· understand the mutual relations of the gilds in any one place
unless we can say how far particular gilds were exclusive, and
how far they included the members of other gilds3 this we can
only determine by an examination of the lists of members¹.
We cannot tell whether relations, if not of affiliation, at least of
indebtedness, can be established between the gilde of distinct
localities, until a very full aud critical examination has been
made of large numbers of statutes. These are fundamental
questions, and though we may all make our own guasses we
do not even begin to lrnow the answers.

The history of Cambridge gilda goes back to pre-Norman
times, and an early set of statutes has survived; but the variety

in the number and names of officials in the later gilds seems
to show that they were not organised in imitation of one

original model, but were affected by influences outside the
town. Though unlilrely, it is not wholly impossible that St
Mary's Gild may have been the lineal representative of the
