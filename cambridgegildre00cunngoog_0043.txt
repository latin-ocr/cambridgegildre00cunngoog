ιο be invoked. In one case it is expressly decreed that members l

may not appeal to law to settle disputes. Ol the three gilds that

contain no allusion to the bishop’s authority, the first, the gild l
which excluded chaplains from membership, orders arbitration ¹

and hints that the power of the law may be invoked: the injured
party is to recover his amends “as best he can.’' The second,

the skinners’ gild, expressly allows appeals to law. The third, l

the St Botulph fraternity of St Mary, makes no arrangement
for dealing with obstinate resistance.

Each gild directs the election of certain officere, who have
the keys of the common chest and must render yearly account.
As a rule there is a head with two assistants. The titles vary3
one has a master and two fellows or helpers, another two rectors,

an alderman and two masters, a warden and two promoterS, a ἒ

master and two alderman, an alderman and two ‘skevins¹'.
Sometimes there are paid officers under them, a dean, a clerk,

an apparitor or summoner, in receipt of small sees for their ,

services. The three elected officers receive no fee, and there is
-a penalty lor refusing office. The terms used with regard ιο
electioris and the admission of new members vary3 all or

the more part of those present must consent to the admission : j

the consent os the brethren “together or separately'' must be
asked, and if all or a majority consent, the candidate is ad·
mitted. The election of officers is in one case made indirectly:
the brethren chose six who chose the officere: in another case
the choice is “per majorem et saniorem partem.” Three more
elaborate processes are detailed. In one the master and two
aldermen chose a clerk and apparitor for their year of office:

the clerk and apparitor with the brethren present chose the .

master and aldermen for the ensuing year. In another, after
the audit ol his accounts, the alderman resigning office chose
seven brethren to choose next year's officers. A majority ol the
electors might decide the choice, but if there was not a majority

then the alderman resigning office might select the officers for
the coming year, taking advice of any he might like ιο ask.
