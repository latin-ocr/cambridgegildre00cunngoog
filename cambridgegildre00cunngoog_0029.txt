the gild. They are rendered at the time required by the
statutos, at Candlemas cr within a fortnight after: they record
the stipenda of the Master and Fellows and their liverieS, and
the charges for the commons of the “ domus '’ or “collegium'‘
Thrcughout the business of the college is referred tc, and by
several phrases, such as ‘I have received from the college' and
the like, the accountant makes it clear that he is in account
with the college, not the gild.

Interesting as these accounts are, it would have been
obviously out cf place tc print them here simply because
they form part cf a manuscript containing gild recorda They
do not once mention the gild. Further it is desirable that
they should some day be published together with the fine
series of the accounts cf the college of which they are the
beginning.

Το retum then tc the early history cf the Corpus Christi
Gild, although we can say little or nothing cf its earlier
history1‚ the minute-book which begins in 1350 shows that a
fiourishing organization was by then in existence. A refer-
ence to an old debt proves that the accounts were not then

Rolls and therefore nc means cf knowing the names of any
members who entered before 1350. The gild is called the

first instance it is not clear that it was attached to a particular ,

chumh, but perhaps from the first it was attached tc St '¹
Bene't's. In October 1350 the reversion cf the advowson

cf whom, Hcrwcod and Tangmere, were 10 bc leading members
of the gild, while a third, Tabletter‚ was prominent among

the fecffors to St Mary’s Gild (Appendix I. Nos. 19, 21).

The unicn of the gilds and the foundation of the college ³

may well have been already contemplated, but of this the first
procf is the mortmain licence ofN0v.1352. Early in 1353,
the united gilda obtained for the Master and college rights in
the advcwscn of St Botulph's, but in the first instance it is
only with St Bene’t's that the gild is connected. A member
