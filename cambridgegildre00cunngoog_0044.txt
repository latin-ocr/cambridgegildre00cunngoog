THE CHANOERY enarmonrrs. xxxv

In the last set of rules it was required that the master
should be chosen by the officere resigning office assisted by
three others from the‘founders,' and no rulo is given to show
how this last body was continued.

It will be seen that these rules vary much in precision.
Some of the best drafted shew however that the Cambridge
burgesses cf the fourteenth century were not ill-trained in
constitutional methods. Indeed it seems to be through the
lower, not the higher manifestatione of the associative principle,

that the doctrine of majorities came home to the popular in-
telligence. Some of these humble gilds had drafted elaborate

rules for electione at a time when larger ‘communities' were
less highly organized. There is a precision about some of these
rules which we seek in vain in the contemporary constitutions
of boroughS‚ of the larger local assemblies, and in the central
assembly of the realm.

The free use made of the bishop's notary¹ may account for
the excellence of these codes Many of the returns from the
villages had to be made in the vulgar tongue‚ and shew a far·
more elementary appreciation of constitutional methods.

The enquiry to which we owe the existence of these returns
was made with the object of discovering what lands were
“mortified'' or not mortified or enfeoffed to the use ol gilds,
and what amount of chattels they possessed. Four of the eight
returned answer that the gild had holanda, rents or chattels.
Two returned no answer on this head. Two made an acknow·
ledgment: one that the gild warden had in his hands 12⁸. Sd.
for the light and other necessaries‚ the other that the gild had
168. in money, a chalice worth 103. and an alb with an amice

worth 3⁸. How far all these answers were strictly truthful may
be doubted.

Little is known ol the later history of these gilds. So sarI
have met with references to only three of them in wills of a

later time*¹ In 1472-13 the Gild of St Katherine in St Andrew's

to England.

ol Peterborough, beginning 1500, contain many bequests to gilde. .
