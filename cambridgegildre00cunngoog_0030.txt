The entrance fees are nearly all in money and wax: there
are a few in wheat and barley, but the Corpus Christi Gild did

receipts it appears that the chest received certain Good Friday
oblatione, and that the gild made 183. by selling a portable
breviary: a house was also sold. The expensos included turs,
probably for firing, the coste of a procession, no doubt the
famous Corpus Christi processiou1, and the buying of maske
and wisora, probably for the play. A gift was made in 1353

this entry attention has frequently been called.

The gild was also presented with a ‘pair of organs,’ an
aumbry, and a silk oushion. Two carpenters, who entered the

proceedings by which the gilds were united, or of those which
led to the creation of the college. Except by a single mention
of the joint dedication of the college, the minutes of the Corpus

Christi Gild, though carried to 1358, and containing a reference
to an event of 13612, ignore entirely the Cild of St Mary. But
in the conveyauces the full title of the Cild ol Corpus Christi
and St Mary is generally used: occasionally efter the union a
