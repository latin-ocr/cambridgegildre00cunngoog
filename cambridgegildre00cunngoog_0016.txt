PREFACE.

HE publication by the Early English Text Society of a

volume on English Gilda in 1870 marks an epoch in our
knowledge of the subject. The collection of statutes, which
was formed and annotated by the late llllr Toulmin Smith and
prepared for the prese by his daughter, affords illustratione,
drawn from every part of the country and of very different
dates, of different types ol' urediaeval associations. To this was
prefixed a brilliant essay by Dr Brentano, who suggested a
scheme of classificati0n‚ and called attention to the far-reaching
interest which attaches to these institutione. He brought out
the analogias which 'may be tra'ced between social organisations
in continental and in English towns, and supplied along line of
ancestors to the Trades Unions of the present day. His views

were so clear that they could not fail to be convincing, and

they were generally accepted for a generaticn as a sufficient
account of the subject.

Further investigation, however, in various quartem, went to
show that the last word had not been spoken. Dr Gross's essay
on the Gilua mercatoria (1883) threw u fresh light on one most
important-part of the subject; and the exhaustive collection of
materials,which he fnrnished in his Gild Merchuut (1890), proved
that Dr Brentano's conclusione on the conflict of merchant
and craft gilda had been too hestily formed, and that English

history could not be safely reconstructed froin continental
